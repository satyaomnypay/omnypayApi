<h2>Account and Registration</h2>

a. Entity Level Acceptance: If you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to "you" in the Terms refer to that entity).
b. Registration: In order to access certain APIs you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the APIs, or as part of your continued use of the APIs. Any registration information you give to OmnyPay will always be accurate and up to date and you'll inform us promptly of any updates.

<h2>Using Our APIs</h2>

a. Permitted Access: You will only access (or attempt to access) an API by the means described in the documentation of that API. If OmnyPay assigns you developer credentials (e.g. client IDs), you must use them with the applicable APIs. You will not misrepresent or mask either your identity or your API Client's identity when using the APIs or developer accounts.
b. API Limitations: OmnyPay sets and enforces limits on your use of the APIs (e.g. limiting the number of API requests that you may make or the number of users you may serve), in our sole discretion. You agree to, and will not attempt to circumvent, such limitations documented with each API. If you would like to use any API beyond these limits, you must obtain OmnyPay's express consent (and OmnyPay may decline such request or condition acceptance on your agreement to additional terms and/or charges for that use). To seek such approval, contact the relevant OmnyPay API team for information (e.g. by using the OmnyPay developers portal).
c. Feedback: If you provide feedback or suggestions about our APIs, then we (and those we allow) may use such information without obligation to you.

<h2>Your API Clients</h2>

a. API Clients and Monitoring: The APIs are designed to help you enhance your ecommerce sites and applications ("API Client(s)"). YOU AGREE THAT OMNYPAY MAY MONITOR USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE QUALITY AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS. 
b. Security: You will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user information collected by your API Client, including personally identifiable information ("PII"), from unauthorized access or use and will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required by applicable law.
d. User Privacy and API Clients: You will comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations including those applying to PII. 

<h2>Prohibitions and Confidentiality</h2>

a. API Prohibitions: When using the APIs, you may not (or allow those acting on your behalf to):
   - Sublicense an API for use by a third party. Consequently, you will not create an API Client that functions substantially the same as the APIs and offer it for use by third parties.
   - Perform an action with the intent of introducing to OmnyPay products and services any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, malware, or any items of a destructive nature.
   - Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others.
   - Interfere with or disrupt the APIs or the servers or networks providing the APIs.
   - Reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any API or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.
   - Use the APIs for any activities where the use or failure of the APIs could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage (such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, or life support systems).
   - Use the APIs to process or store any data that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State.
   - Remove, obscure, or alter any OmnyPay terms of service or any links to or notices of those terms.

b. Confidential Matters
   - Developer credentials (such as passwords, keys, and client IDs) are intended to be used by you and identify your API Client. You will keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials. Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.
   - Our communications to you and our APIs may contain OmnyPay confidential information. OmnyPay confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances. If you receive any such information, then you will not disclose it to any third party without OmnyPay's prior written consent. OmnyPay confidential information does not include information that you independently developed, that was rightfully given to you by a third party without confidentiality obligation, or that becomes public through no fault of your own. You may disclose OmnyPay confidential information when compelled to do so by law if you provide us reasonable prior notice, unless a court orders that we not receive notice.


<h2>Termination</h2>

a. Termination You may stop using our APIs at any time with or without notice. Further, if you want to terminate the Terms, you must provide OmnyPay with prior written notice and upon termination, cease your use of the applicable APIs. OmnyPay reserves the right to terminate the Terms with you or discontinue the APIs or any portion or feature or your access thereto for any reason and at any time without liability or other obligation to you.

<h2>Liability for our APIs</h2>

A. WARRANTIES EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THE TERMS, OMNYPAY DOES NOT  MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE APIS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT ACCESSED THROUGH THE APIS, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE APIS, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE APIS "AS IS".
SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THE TERMS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND UNDERTAKINGS.

B. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, OMNYPAY WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA; FINANCIAL LOSSES; OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF OMNYPAY FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE APPLICABLE APIS (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE APIS AGAIN) DURING THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.

IN ALL CASES, OMNYPAY WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY EXPENSE, LOSS, OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.

c. Indemnification Unless prohibited by applicable law, if you are a business, you will defend and indemnify OmnyPay, and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and users, against all liabilities, damages, losses, costs, fees (including legal fees), and expenses relating to any allegation or third-party legal proceeding to the extent arising from:
your misuse or your end user's misuse of the APIs;your violation or your end user's violation of the Terms; or any content or data routed into or used with the APIs by you, those acting on your behalf, or your end users.


<h2>General Provisions</h2>

a. Modification We may modify the Terms or any portion to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our APIs. You should look at the Terms regularly. We'll post notice of modifications to the Terms within the documentation of each applicable API, to this website, and/or in the OmnyPay developers console. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than 30 days after they are posted. But changes addressing new functions for an API or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified Terms for an API, you should discontinue your use of that API. Your continued use of the API constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms.

b. General Legal Terms We each agree to contract in the English language. If we provide a translation of the Terms, we do so for your convenience only and the English Terms will solely govern our relationship. The Terms do not create any third party beneficiary rights or any agency, partnership, or joint venture. Nothing in the Terms will limit either party's ability to seek injunctive relief. We are not liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If you do not comply with the Terms, and OmnyPay does not take action right away, this does not mean that OmnyPay is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The Terms are the entire agreement between you and OmnyPay relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject. For information about how to contact OmnyPay, please email info@omnypay.net.
Except as set forth below: (i) the laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California's conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or related to the Terms or the APIs and (ii) ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TERMS OR THE APIS WILL BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, USA, AND YOU AND OMNYPAY CONSENT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN THOSE COURTS.
